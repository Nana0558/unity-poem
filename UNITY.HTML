    <h1>POEM</h1>
    <h2>UNITY POEM</h2>
    <p>If i were told that i must die tomorrow,<br>
        That the next sun <br>
        which sinks should bear one past all fear and sorrow <br>
        For anyone,<br>
        All the fight fought, all the short journey through;<br>
        What should i do?<br>
        I do not think that i should shrink or falter,<br>
        But just go on,<br>
        Doing my work, nor change, nor seek to alter <br>
        Aught that is gone;<br>
        But rise and move and love and smile and pray <br>
        For one more day <br>
    </p>
